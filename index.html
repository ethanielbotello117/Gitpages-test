    <h1>How to make hummus!</h1>

    <h2><u style="text-decoration-line: underline">These are the ingredients you are going to need.</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li> A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is how you make it.</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
    </ol>

    <p> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <u style="text-decoration-line: underline">Storage</u>

    <p> Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
    <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
